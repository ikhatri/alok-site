Hi! My name is Alok and I am a senior global strategic business leader. I help companies drive profitable revenue growth through Commercial Excellence, Pricing, Contracting, and Strategic Account strategies that increase revenue and gross margins. My employers have witnessed an increase in revenue &amp; gross margin in their P&amp;L due to the commercial excellence framework I implemented.

I have expertise in enterprise sales planning, business operations, variable compensation design, market sizing &amp; sales territory planning, and execution of enterprise-wide commercial excellence for enablement of pricing, contracting &amp; revenue growth management capability. I've led variable compensation design at global, matrixed organizations to drive accelerated business value. And my expertise is in optimizing business outcomes that balance revenue and margin growth by driving digital transformation built on operations execution, business strategy, monitoring KPIs, robust governance, and actionable commercial insights.

I have work experience in the B2B Semi-conductors equipment and Med-tech industries working for Applied Materials, Danaher, Medtronic, Philips Healthcare and GE Healthcare.

I received my MBA from McGill University, Quebec, Canada, My MMS from SPJIMR, and Bachelors of Engineering in Electrical &amp; Electronics from Birla Institute of Technology.
